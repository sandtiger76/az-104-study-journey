# 🔬 Labs

## 📘 Introduction
This section contains task-based, hands-on labs created as part of my preparation for the Microsoft Azure Administrator (AZ-104) certification. Each lab focuses on a specific Azure service or concept, providing step-by-step instructions, CLI scripts, and supporting assets to reinforce practical understanding.
These labs are designed to be modular and focused, allowing you to explore individual components of Azure administration in isolation.

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:
- Document real-world Azure tasks performed during AZ-104 preparation
- Help others who are studying for the AZ-104 certification by providing practical, real-world examples and documentation.
- Serve as a reference for future Azure projects
- Showcase practical skills in identity, compute, networking, monitoring, and app deployment

## 📚 AZ-104 Course Labs

These Microsoft labs are designed to prepare you for the AZ-104: Microsoft Azure Administrator exam, following the official course structure with modules and hands-on exercises. Where possible, I’ve added my own cleanup instructions, commands, or scripts to help you reset the mock lab environment and minimize Azure costs.
