Welcome to my personal documentation and project repository for the Microsoft Azure Administrator (AZ-104) certification.
This repo serves as a practical journal of the hands-on tasks and projects I completed while preparing for the exam.

The goal of this repository is to:

- Document real-world Azure tasks performed during AZ-104 preparation
- Reinforce my own learning through hands-on practice and GitHub version control
- Serve as a reference for future Azure projects
- Optionally help others studying for AZ-104 by sharing practical examples
- Showcase practical skills in identity, compute, networking, monitoring, and app deployment
