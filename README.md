# AZ-104 Study Journey

Welcome to my personal documentation and project repository for the **Microsoft Azure Administrator (AZ-104)** certification.

This repo serves as a practical journal of the hands-on tasks I completed while studying for AZ-104. Each markdown file represents a focused implementation of a specific Azure service or concept, with screenshots, CLI scripts, and step-by-step instructions.

---

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:
- Document real-world Azure tasks performed during AZ-104 preparation
- Help others who are studying for the AZ-104 certification by providing practical, real-world examples and documentation.
- Serve as a reference for future Azure projects
- Showcase practical skills in identity, compute, networking, monitoring, and app deployment
