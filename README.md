# AZ-104 Study Journey

Welcome to my personal documentation and project repository for the **Microsoft Azure Administrator (AZ-104)** certification.

This repo serves as a practical journal of the hands-on tasks I completed while studying for AZ-104. Each markdown file represents a focused implementation of a specific Azure service or concept, with screenshots, CLI scripts, and step-by-step instructions.

---

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:
- Document real-world Azure tasks performed during AZ-104 preparation
- Help others who are studying for the AZ-104 certification by providing practical, real-world examples and documentation.
- Serve as a reference for future Azure projects
- Showcase practical skills in identity, compute, networking, monitoring, and app deployment

### Identity & Access
This project involves deploying a virtual machine, securing it using RBAC, applying Azure Policies for resource governance, encrypting sensitive data, and monitoring costs. It teaches foundational concepts for managing Azure identities, governance, and compute resources.

[Identity & Access](https://github.com/sandtiger76/az-104-study-journey/blob/master/Project_1_Compute_and_Identity.md)

### Networking & Storage
This project covers deploying a secure storage account, creating VNets and NSGs for isolation, enabling encryption, and automating resource deployment using ARM templates. It demonstrates networking and storage fundamentals.
